# Enigma-Machine

This is an implementation for the Enigma machiche in Java. 

There is a folder called "res" where the txt files are for the input and the output of the Enigma Machine. If those files don't exist, they are automatically created.
I have extended the Enigma Machine so that you can use the console as inputting plugs, setting the types of the rotors and their positions.
Moreover, you can add as many plugs as you can. Everything is explained with messages - what you need to input and how you can do it.
I also started implementing a console/command interface, but unfortunately I didn't have enough time to finish it.
